# BackTracking_SM

In this repository, I am defining a minimal code in Python to test strategies on historical data of the stock market.
These strategies are solely based on price movements.

The data is fetched from Yahoo; it comprises the last two years of symbols from the Health Technology Sector.
It is provided in "Health_Tech_2Y_1h_19May.csv".

The code to apply one (or multiple strategies by uncommenting some lines) is given in the function "Try_One_Strategy.py",
which depends on "Functions_for_Strategy_Testing.py".

The code is rather straightforward and easy to pick up. Feel free to contact me if you have any questions or comments.

Disclosure information:
This code is based on historical data, and there can be no assurance regarding future market movements. Moreover, you should double-check it to ensure there are no errors or misunderstandingsâ€”I am not responsible for any losses or damages resulting from its use.
